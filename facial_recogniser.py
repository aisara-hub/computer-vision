# steps
# 1. Build system for list of know faces
#       a. process face
#       b. embedding of face
#       c. save locally for retrieval
# 2. Build system for faces detected by system
#       a. process face
#       b. embeddings
# 3. Predictive model
#       a. load known embeddings
#       b. normalisation
#       c. encoding
#       d. choose a model
#       e. train and predict
